> The lives we don't experience are as good as myths to us.

> നാം അനുഭവിക്കാത്ത ജീവിതങ്ങളെല്ലാം നമുക്ക് വെറും കെട്ടുകഥകള്‍ മാത്രമാണ്.

I’m borrowing this quote by Benyamin from his book Aadujeevitham (ആടുജീവിതം). 
Life has taught me the truth of these words. My experiences taught me the possibilities of life. 
But alas, life is short, and so are my experiences. To tear down my misconceptions of lives I’ve missed out on, I used to be an avid reader. 
And then life got busy, and books consume a lot of time. 
I found a better alternative - **motion pictures**.

The extra visual and auditory dimensions brought to the table by movies, web series, and documentaries give a much richer experience when compared to text alone. 
Ever since, I’ve watched a lot and critically analyzed the lives of people each story tells. 
After I opened my mind to languages I couldn’t speak, I’m awed by how similar and diverse our cultures are. 
I will list out every title I watch from now onwards and the ones I’ve already watched. 
I do not know how to articulate the politics, ideologies, and fantasies these titles showcase and their technical marvels. 
Hence I will just include one or two liners on what I think about them.

I’ve tried my best to avoid commercial flicks, which do not bring anything new for me; 
hence each title stands good on its own, 
making order in this list of no particular significance.
