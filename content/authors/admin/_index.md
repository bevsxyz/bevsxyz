# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a budding scientist, trained in biology. I have been fortunate to see the world around me as an amalgam of levels of complex systems resulting in emergent behaviour. Using mathematical and computational approach I believe that I will be able to figure out the micro-rules governing the different systems.

I am a student of biology transitioning to more theoretical sciences. I love programming and playing with mathematical reasoning. I also do a lot of agent based modeling.

I am inspire by complex systems. I see a lot of them. I am aiming to understand them better using mathematical and computational approach. I hope in time I get to play with some of the more advanced questions in Physics as well.
