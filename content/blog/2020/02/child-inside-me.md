A piece that came to me, when I was alone at break of the dawn. Depression is hard on it's own; it is harder when people around you wanna help you but their idea of help is not what you need.

When I look inside of me,

I see a child.

I can hear him crying. Wailing!

My heart yearns to console him,

to say it's alright,

this is just a phase..

Alas! all I feel is numbness,

eating me from the inside.
